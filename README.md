# json-inspector
A JSON viewer and diff checker made using Electron JS and Angular 7

# Instructions
After cloning the repo, run the following command to start the application
```
npm start
```

This will build the Angular application in development mode and start the electron app.

The 'package.json' can be tweaked as per your choice.

In order to build the app for Windows (64-bit), run the command
```
npm run package-win
```
This will create a folder in the project directory called 'release-builds'.

Other package scripts have been added but not implemented.
Please feel free to make changes in the scripts and submit PRs.
Happy to accept any contribution from your end.
